# Submission KADE 

This is repository for submission on class KADE (Kotlin Android Developer Expert) on Dicoding. [More info](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/55)

Keep in mind that coding is very **anti-plagiarism**.

If you use this repository for learning and contribution I strongly agree, but if it is used for submission, it is encoded by copy and paste, I strongly discourage it.

I am not responsible for any warnings and prohibitions from dicoding.com if you ignore my warnings.

this is screenshot App on final project(Submission 5):
